# Walmart Sales Data Visualization (Learning Project)

This project is part of my learning journey into **Data Engineering**. It demonstrates how to connect to a cloud data warehouse from Python, run analytical queries, apply lightweight transformations, and generate interactive visualizations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Objective**: Explore and visualize Walmart sales and related economic indicators.  
- **Workflow**:  
  1. Connect to **Snowflake** using **SQLAlchemy**  
  2. Run SQL queries to fetch subsets of data  
  3. Perform minor transformations in **Pandas**  
  4. Build charts with **Plotly** and save them to a local directory  
- **Focus Areas**:  
  - Programmatic warehouse access from Python  
  - Query + transform + visualize workflow  
  - Reproducible analytics pipeline  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
  - [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) – Snowflake connection  
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – data manipulation  
  - [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) – interactive charts  

---

## 📊 Example Outputs
- Weekly sales trends over time  
- Sales vs. fuel price, unemployment, and CPI  
- Holiday vs. non-holiday sales comparisons  

Charts are automatically saved into the `/output_charts/` directory as images for easy review.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Gain hands-on practice connecting Python applications to a data warehouse  
- Learn how to combine **SQL queries with Python transformations**  
- Practice generating **visual reports** for business analysis

## 📌 Notes
This is a **learning project** created as part of my Data Engineer Academy course.  
It is not intended for production use, but demonstrates the Python-based analytics layer of a larger warehouse and modeling project.
